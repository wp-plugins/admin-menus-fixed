Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu + WordPress Toolbar + Standard Admin Menu Fixed to the Top of the Admin Screens. Less Scrolling!

== Description ==

### What you need, where you need it - and when. ###

**For WordPress 3.5+ - Backward compatibile to WordPress 3.2 (see Other Notes).**
**Works with: [*Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* 3.6+](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/) and [*AG Custom Admin* 1.2.5+](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ag-custom-admin/)**

**Admin Menus Fixed Three Ways:** As a companion to ***Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu*** AND/OR ***AG Custom Admin*** OR ***Standalone***.

**Incorporates HoverIntent** to chill the Toolbar drop-down menu hair trigger, so now you can overshoot Ozh' Menu without the Toolbar menu falsely stepping on it; causing you to move away until it closes, so that you can get to what you were going for. Way easier to work this way. Fast. Efficient.

* Consolidates the WordPress Toolbar and Ozh's menu and makes them both such that you always have them readily available at the top of your window; no matter how long the page may be or where you happen to be scrolled.

* Automatically adjusts to the WordPress Toolbar display state; whether disabled by *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* or *AG Custom Admin*.

* Compresses upper Admin screen element positions; bringing more of the page content into view.

**Standalone:** The WordPress Toolbar and standard Admin Menu along the left side are made fixed-position in both expanded and collapsed modes; eliminating a lot of scrolling.

* See the [Screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-menus-fixed/screenshots/) for all of the combinations.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2.1 =

* Removed compatibility with WordPress Versions older than 3.2. You should be way past that by now; 'cuz... it's time.

= 1.2 =

* Compatibility with WordPress 3.5+ and	 *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* and *AG Custom Admin* Toolbar Removal.

= 1.1.1 =

* Compatibility with WordPress 3.4+. Code cleanup.

= 1.1 =

* Compatibility with WordPress 3.3+. Incorporates HoverIntent on the Toolbar drop-down's hair trigger, increasing the delay for better navigation. Code rewriitten for better compatibility according to conventional practice.

= 1.0 =

* Compatibility with WordPress 3.2+. Makes the standard WordPress Admin Menu fixed-position in both expanded and collapsed modes if installed Standalone.

= 0.6 =

* Now operates Standalone; accommodating the *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* being deactivated without having to deactivate Admin Menus Fixed first. This allows the compressed and fixed position attributes of the WordPress Admin Bar to be retained, so the plugin can be used with the standard WordPress Admin Menu as well.

= 0.3 =

* First public release following an encouraging suggestion made by Ozh, after he saw my hack, to develop a companion plugin. Thanks, Ozh!

== Installation ==

= Installation as usual: =

1. Upload plugin directory to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress Plugins menu.
3. May be Network Activated by Multisite Network Admin (recommended if Ozh's plugin is Network Activated but it is not necessary that the activation methods match). Network Activation is required in WP 3.2+ for the plugin to work in Network Admin screens.
4. *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* and/or *AG Custom Admin* not required but are really cool. You should try them out. I've used *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* for years and wouldn't work without it.

= Upgrading =

* Overwrite the current admin-menus-fixed/ directory and all contents.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure it? =

No configuration is necessary. It works all by itself.

= This is cool. How can I support your effort? =

== Other Notes ==

**V3.2 Only**

* Consolidates the Admin Header's User Menu with the Site Title on the left; where all of the other menus are.

* **WordPress Admin Bar is optional.** Automatically adjusts to the display setting of the Admin Bar in the backend.  
  Toggle: **Your Profile** > **Show Admin Bar** > **in dashboard** checkbox. Menus reformat to accommodate the chosen setting.

* Check that the **Show Admin Bar** toggle in **Your Profile** works and the drop-downs extend and you're good to go.
