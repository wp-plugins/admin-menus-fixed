Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu + WordPress Admin Bar + Admin Header in a stacked, compressed configuration fixed to the top of the Admin screens.

== Description ==

### What you need, where you need it - and when. ###

**For WordPress 3.2+ - Backward compatibile with WordPress 3.1+.**
**Works with: [Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu 3.5+ and 3.6+](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/)**

**Fixed Admin Menus Both Ways:** As a companion to Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu **OR** Standalone.

* Consolidates Ozh's menu, the WordPress Admin Bar and Admin Header and makes them all fixed-position, so that you always have them readily available at the top of your window; no matter how long the page may be.

* All three fit in darn near the same space as the standard bars do alone. Enjoy more screen real estate and less scrolling!

* Consolidates the Admin Header's User Menu with the Site Title on the left; where all of the other menus are.

* Compresses upper Admin screen element positions; bringing more of the page content "above the fold".

* If installed Standalone, or Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu is deactivated, the standard Admin Menu along the left side is made fixed-position, in both expanded and collapsed modes, and the Admin Header still displays fixed-position and consolidated, as above.

* **WordPress Admin Bar is optional.** Automatically adjusts to the display/not display setting of the Admin Bar in the backend.  
  Toggle: **Your Profile** > **Show Admin Bar** > **in dashboard** checkbox. Menus reformat to accommodate the chosen setting.
  
* See the [Screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-menus-fixed/screenshots/) for all of the combinations.

For the backstory, a comprehensive overview and support, see the [Fixed Admin Menus - The Plugin](http://blog.imperialearth.com/wordpress/fixed-admin-menus-the-plugin/) page series.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =

* Compatibility with WordPress 3.2+. Makes the standard WordPress Admin Menu fixed-position in both expanded and collapsed modes if installed Standalone.

= 0.6 =

* Now operates Standalone; accommodating the Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu being deactivated without having to deactivate Fixed Admin Menus first. This allows the compressed and fixed position attributes of the WordPress Admin Header to be retained, so the plugin can be used with the standard WordPress Admin Menu as well.

= 0.3 =

* First public release following an encouraging suggestion made by Ozh, after he saw my hack, to develop a companion plugin. Thanks, Ozh!

== Installation ==

= Installation as usual: =

1. Upload plugin directory to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. May be Network Activated by Multisite Network Admin (recommended if Ozh's plugin is Network Activated but it is not necessary that the activation methods match). Network Activation is required in WP 3.2+ for the plugin to work in Network Admin screens.
4. Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu not required but it is really cool. You should try it out. I've used it for years and wouldn't work without it.

= Upgrading =

* Overwrite the current admin-menus-fixed/ directory and all contents.
* Check that the **Show Admin Bar** toggle in **Your Profile** works and the drop-downs extend and you're good to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure it? =

No configuration is necessary. It works all by itself.

= This is cool. How can I support your effort? =

= Will you write a plugin for WordPress versions earlier than 3.1? =

Now that we're two major releases farther on from 3.0, it's probably not worth it. Keeping up with new releases is extensive enough. You should upgrade your install anyway.
