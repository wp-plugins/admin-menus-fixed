Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu + all WordPress Admin Menus available in a stacked, compressed configuration fixed to the top of the Admin screens.

== Description ==

**For WordPress 3.1+ only.**
**Requires Plugin: [Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu 3.5.0+](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/)**

**What you need, where you need it - and when.**

* Consolidates Ozh's menu, the WordPress 3.1+ Admin Bar and Admin Menu and makes them all fixed position, so that you always have them readily available at the top of your window.
* All three fit in darn near the same space as the standard 3.1+ menus do alone. Enjoy more screen real estate and less scrolling!
* Automatically adjusts to display/not display setting of the Admin Bar in the backend.
* Toggle: **Your Profile** > **Show Admin Bar** > **in dashboard** checkbox. Menus reformat to accommodate the chosen setting.

For the backstory, a comprehensive overview nnd support, see the [Fixed Admin Menus - The Plugin](http://blog.imperialearth.com/wordpress/fixed-admin-menus-the-plugin/) pages.

== Changelog ==

0.3 First public release following an encouraging suggestion made by Ozh, after he saw my hack, to develop a companion plugin. Thanks, Ozh!

== Installation ==

Installation as usual:

1. Upload plugin directory to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. May be Network Activated by Multisite Network Admin (advisable if Ozh's plugin is Network Activated but it is not necesssary that the activation methods match).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure it? =

No configuration is necessary. It works all by itself.

= This is cool. How can I support your effort? =

If you'd like to help a real starving artist, please [buy me a burger, a taco or some cat food for our rescues.](http://sphericalmagic.com/plugins/donate.shtml)

= Will you write a plugin for WordPress versions earlier than 3.1? =

If there is enough call for it, yes. 3.0.5 and earlier are easier to handle. [Contact me](http://imperialearth.com/bejhail.shtml) and I'll bang one together. Problem is, all of my installs are now 3.1+, so you'd have to test it for me or I'd have to create a database and install 3.0.5 just for that.

== Upgrade Notice ==
