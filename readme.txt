Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu + all WordPress Admin Menus available in a stacked, compressed configuration fixed to the top of the Admin screens.

== Description ==

**For WordPress 3.1+ only.**

**Requires Plugin: [Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/)**

**What you need, where you need it - and when.**

* Consolidates Ozh's menu, the WordPress 3.1+ Admin Bar and Admin Menu and makes them all fixed position, so that you always have their availability at the top of your window.
* All three fit in darn near the same space as the standard 3.1+ menus do alone. Enjoy more screen real estate and less scrolling!
* Automatically adjusts to display/not display setting of the Admin Bar in the backend.
* Toggle: **Your Profile** > **Show Admin Bar** > **in dashboard** checkbox. Menus reformat to accommodate the new setting.

== Changelog ==

0.3 First public release following an encouraging suggestion made by Ozh, after he saw my hack, to develop a companion plugin. Thanks, Ozh!

== Installation ==

Installation as usual:

1. Upload plugin directory to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. May be Network Activated by Multisite Network Admin (advisable if Ozh's plugin is Network Activated but it is not necesssary that the activation methods match).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No configuration is necessary. It works all by itself.
