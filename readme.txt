Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu + WordPress Toolbar & Admin Menu Fixed to the Top and Side of the Admin Screens. Less Scrolling!

== Description ==

### What you need, where you need it - and when. ###

**For WordPress 3.8 to 4.2+ - Backward compatibile to WordPress 3.5 (see [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-menus-fixed/other_notes/))**
**Works with: [*Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* 3.6+](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/) and [*AG Custom Admin* 1.2.5+](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ag-custom-admin/)**

**Admin Menus Fixed Three Ways:** As a companion to ***Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu*** AND/OR ***AG Custom Admin*** OR ***Standalone*** (WordPress 3.5-3.7)

* **New in v1.4** Now Responsive down to phone sizes. *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* header background automatically changes to high contrast when displayed on smaller screens.

* **New in v1.4** *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* Header Gradient now wraps when the header does; improving the look and readability!

* Consolidates the WordPress Toolbar and Ozh's menu and makes them both always readily available at the top of your window; no matter where you happen to be scrolled on a long page.

* Incorporates HoverIntent to chill the Toolbar drop-down menu hair trigger, so now you can overshoot Ozh' Menu without the Toolbar menu falsely stepping on it; causing you to move away until it closes, so that you can get to what you were going for. Way easier to work this way. Fast. Efficient.

* Automatically adjusts to the WordPress Toolbar display state; whether disabled by *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* or *AG Custom Admin*.

**Standalone:** (Depreciated) The WordPress Devs have taken a page from this plugin's book, pulling the concept into core by fixed-positioning the Toolbar and Admin Menus in versions 3.8+, so the plugin code is shrinking. Kinda goes against the new direction of pulling code *out* of core and having plugins handle the function if you want/need it, but I'm glad that the concept has been adopted; because it was long overdue. The plugin is returning to its own core purpose, that of enhancing *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu*, and I'm OK with that. - see [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-menus-fixed/other_notes/)

== Installation ==

= Installation as usual: =

1. Upload plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress Plugins menu.
3. May be Network Activated by Multisite Network Admin (recommended if Ozh's plugin is Network Activated but it is not necessary that the activation methods match). Network Activation is required in WP 3.2+ for the plugin to work in Network Admin screens.
4. *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* and/or *AG Custom Admin* not required but are really cool. You should try them out. I've used *Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu* for years and wouldn't work without it.

= Upgrading =

* Overwrite the current `/admin-menus-fixed/` directory and all contents.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure it? =

No configuration is necessary. It works all by itself.
