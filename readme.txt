Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu + WordPress Admin Bar and Menu available in a stacked, compressed configuration fixed to the top of the Admin screens.

== Description ==

### What you need, where you need it - and when. ###

**For WordPress 3.1+ only.**  
**Works with: [Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu 3.5.0+](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/)**  

* Consolidates Ozh's menu, the WordPress 3.1+ Admin Bar and Admin Menu and makes them all fixed position, so that you always have them readily available at the top of your window; no mnatter how long the page may be.

* All three fit in darn near the same space as the standard 3.1+ menus do alone. Enjoy more screen real estate and less scrolling!

* **Now works standalone.** If Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu is deactivated (why?), the compressed WordPress Admin Menu moves up, still retaining its compressed and fixed position attributes.

* **WordPress Admin Bar is optional.** Automatically adjusts to the display/not display setting of the Admin Bar in the backend.  
  Toggle: **Your Profile** > **Show Admin Bar** > **in dashboard** checkbox. Menus reformat to accommodate the chosen setting.
  
* See the [Screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-menus-fixed/screenshots/) for all of the combinations.

For the backstory, a comprehensive overview and support, see the [Fixed Admin Menus - The Plugin](http://blog.imperialearth.com/wordpress/fixed-admin-menus-the-plugin/) page series.

== Changelog ==

= 0.6 =

* Now operates standalone; accommodating the Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu being deactivated without having to deactivate Fixed Admin Menus first. This allows the compressed and fixed position attributes of the WordPress Admin Menu to be retained, so the plugin can be used with the standard WordPress menus as well.

= 0.3 =

* First public release following an encouraging suggestion made by Ozh, after he saw my hack, to develop a companion plugin. Thanks, Ozh!

== Installation ==

= Installation as usual: =

1. Upload plugin directory to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. May be Network Activated by Multisite Network Admin (advisable if Ozh's plugin is Network Activated but it is not necesssary that the activation methods match).
4. Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu not required but it is really cool. You should try it out. I've used it for years and wouldn't work without it.

= Upgrading =

* Overwrite the current admin-menus-fixed/ directory and all contents.
* Check that the **Show Admin Bar** toggle in **Your Profile** works and the drop-downs extend and you're good to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure it? =

No configuration is necessary. It works all by itself.

= This is cool. How can I support your effort? =

If you'd like to help a real starving artist, please [buy me a burger, a taco or some cat food for our rescues.](http://sphericalmagic.com/plugins/donate.shtml)

= Will you write a plugin for WordPress versions earlier than 3.1? =

If there is enough call for it, yes. 3.0.5 and earlier are easier to handle. [Contact me](http://imperialearth.com/bejhail.shtml) and I'll bang one together. Problem is, all of my installs are now 3.1+, so you'd have to test it for me or I'd have to create a database and install 3.0.5 just for that.
